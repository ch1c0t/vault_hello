The containers expect to get the Vault credentials from the host's file system.
Specifically, these 3 files are expected to be present:

- /tmp/vault/endpoint
- /tmp/vault/key
- /tmp/vault/token

`/tmp/vault/endpoint` is an address where Vault will be listening at, in plain text. `http://vault:8200` is expected by the containers.

`/tmp/vault/key` is a symmetric key for encrypting and decrypting Vault token. It can be generated as follows:

[source,bash]
----
coffee src/create_key.coffee /tmp/vault/key
----

`/tmp/vault/token` is an encrypted Vault token. For the token `s0me-d3v-t0k3n`, it can be generated as follows:

[source,bash]
----
coffee src/encrypt_token.coffee [token-in-plain-text] [/path/to/file/for/storing/encrypted_token]
coffee src/encrypt_token.coffee s0me-d3v-t0k3n /tmp/vault/token
----
