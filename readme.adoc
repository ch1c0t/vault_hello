The containers expect to get the Vault credentials from the host's file system.
Specifically, the 3 files are expected to be present:

- /tmp/vault/address
- /tmp/vault/key
- /tmp/vault/token

`/tmp/vault/address` is an address where Vault will be listening at, in plain text. For example, `http://vault:8200`.

`/tmp/vault/key` is a symmetric key for encrypting and decrypting Vault token. It can be generated as follows:

[source,bash]
----
coffee src/create_key.coffee /tmp/vault/key
----

`/tmp/vault/token` is an encrypted Vault token. For the token `s0me-d3v-t0k3n`, it can be generated as follows:

[source,bash]
----
coffee src/encrypt_token.coffee s0me-d3v-t0k3n /tmp/vault/token
----
